# Development
## WandXOptions-Dapp Front End Deployment over dev environment
* cd app/
* npm install (Have to do one time only, when setting up the project)
* cd node_modules/wandx-options
* npm install (Have to do one time only, when setting up the project)
* npm run ganache-cli

	-->  confirm that metamask is connected to localhost
* npm run compile-dummytoken
* npm run migrate-dev
* Manual step, this will be changed in compile-dummytoken script in next update
Open app/node_modules/wandx_options/build folder, open file dummyTokenBaseInfo.json.
Replace address in the file with {"address":"<address string>"}
example, original file data -> 0xf322BE32FEb8ac0Bd75216BcB8d07214251C4376
new file data -> {"address":"0xf322BE32FEb8ac0Bd75216BcB8d07214251C4376"}
